# Difference Between Vector & Deque

|Feature|`std::vector`|`std::deque`|
|---|---|---|
|**Memory Layout**|Contiguous block of memory|Multiple non-contiguous blocks (segmented memory)|
|**Access Speed**|Fast random access (O(1))|Fast random access (O(1), slightly slower than `vector`)|
|**Insertion at End**|Efficient (`push_back()` is amortized O(1))|Efficient (`push_back()` is O(1))|
|**Insertion at Front**|**Inefficient** (O(n))|**Efficient** (`push_front()` is O(1))|
|**Insertion in Middle**|O(n)|O(n)|
|**Iterator Validity**|Invalidated by resizing|Insertions/removals at front/back **do not** invalidate iterators to other elements|
|**Cache Locality**|Better (contiguous memory)|Worse (non-contiguous blocks)|
|**Memory Overhead**|Lower|Higher (due to segmented structure)|
|**Capacity Management**|Has `capacity()`, `reserve()`, `shrink_to_fit()`|Lacks these functions|
|**Use Case**|When most operations are at the back and fast access is needed|When frequent insertions/removals at both ends are needed|
### Summary:

- Use **`vector`** when:    
    - You need efficient random access and memory locality.
    - Most insertions/removals are at the **back**.
    - You need to manage memory manually via `reserve()` or `shrink_to_fit()`.

- Use **`deque`** when:
    - You need to insert or remove elements from **both ends** frequently.
    - Slightly higher memory overhead is acceptable.
    - You need stable performance for front/back operations.
