Standard Template Library (STL) provides the built-in implementation of commonly used data structures known as containers. A container is a holder object that stores a collection of other objects (its elements). They are implemented as class templates, which allows great flexibility in the data types supported.

A container manages the storage space for its elements and provides member functions for easy access to useful operations.

## Types of STL Containers

STL containers are divided into the following categories:

1. **Sequence Containers**
2. **Associative Containers**
3. **Unordered Containers**
4. **Container Adapters**

## 1. Sequence Containers
Sequence containers implement linear data structures in which the elements can be accessed sequentially. Following are the sequence containers in C++ STL:

| Container Name   | Description                                                                                |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Array**        | Container that wraps over fixed size static array.                                         |
| **Vector**       | Automatically resizable dynamic array.                                                     |
| **Deque**        | Dynamic array of fixed-size arrays that allows fast insertions and deletions at both ends. |
| **List**         | Implementation of Doubly Linked List data structure.                                       |
| **Forward List** | Implementation of Singly Linked List data structure.                                       |

---
## 2. Associative Containers
Associative containers store data in some sorted order. It provides fast search, insert and delete in O(log n) time by using balanced trees like Red Black Trees. 

| Container Name | Description                                                                                            |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Set**        | Collection of unique elements sorted on the basis of their values.                                     |
| **Map**        | Collection of key-value pairs sorted on the basis of the keys where no two pairs have same keys.       |
| **Multiset**   | Collection of elements sorted on the basis of their values but allows multiple copies of values.       |
| **Multimap**   | Collection of key-value pairs sorted on the basis of the keys where multiple pairs can have same keys. |

---
## 3. Unordered Associative Containers
Unordered associative containers implement unsorted hashed data structures that can be quickly searched (O(1) amortized, O(n) worst-case complexity).

| Container Name         | Description                                                                                          |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Unordered Set**      | Collection of unique elements hashed by their values.                                                |
| **Unordered Map**      | Collection of key-value pairs that are hashed by their keys where no two pairs have same keys.       |
| **Unordered Multiset** | Collection of elements hashed by their values and allows multiple copies of values.                  |
| **Unordered Multimap** | Collection of key-value pairs that are hashed by their keys where multiple pairs can have same keys. |

## 4. Container Adapters
Container adapters provide a different interface for other containers. They adapt the behavior of underlying containers to fit specific use cases.

| Container Name     | Description                                                |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Stack**          | Adapts a container to provide stack (LIFO) data structure. |
| **Queue**          | Adapts a container to provide queue (FIFO) data structure. |
| **Priority Queue** | Adapts a container to provide heap data structure.         |
